first project in Revature Training

Norwegian International Corporate Expertise Banking

this is my first use of github at all
this is also my first project as a revature junior software engineer trainee
my objective is to create a very simple banking application that has very basic functionality

each client has a unique identifier generated by uuid(String), first name(String), last name(String), account(Array type)

account has two values inside it: balance(Number), accountType(String)

my basic functions are

create a client

retrieve all clients

retrieve a speceific client

delete a specific client

update first name or last name or both in a client found by id
